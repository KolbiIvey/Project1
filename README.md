    Welcome to Simple Slots! A game of, well you guessed it, simple slots.
    In this game you have a starting balance of 100$, and the only goal is 
    times you can win before you run out of money! To spin the slots you
    simply slap that Bet $10 button and it will automatically tak $10 from 
    your current Balance. If all three slots match, you get $15 back into your
    balance! All three slots much be matching for you to receive more money!
    Once you reach $0 or go into the negatives, the game is over and you lose.
    After you lose, just hit the reset button and you're all set to keep 
    trying your luck! Have fun!

        I plan on eventually coming back to this game and updating the entire thing.
        I plan to add images instead of numbers for my slots to cycle through, 
        I also plan on adding more functionality like you would see in a real life 
        slot machine such as inserting your money first and then betting on a certain 
        matchup or row. Overall I plan to Revamp the game but still try and keep it simple.
