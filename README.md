Welcome to Simple Slots! A game of, well you guessed it, simple slots.
In this game you have a starting balance of $100, and the only goal is 
times you can win before you run out of money! To spin the slots you
simply slap that Bet $10 button and it will automatically tak $10 from 
your current Balance. If all three slots match, you get $15 back into your
balance! All three slots much be matching for you to receive more money!
Once you reach $0 or go into the negatives, the game is over and you lose.
After you lose, just hit the reset button and you're all set to keep 
trying your luck! Have fun!
