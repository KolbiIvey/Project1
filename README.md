# Simple Slots!


                           //PSUEDO CODE

STEP 1. build out your html so that you have three slot machine "windows" 
        - create a container div that holds the three windows, the buttons and the current balance of the player
        - assign classes and id's as necessary
        - set and h1 that reads 'Let's play Slots!'
        - create an input for the amount of money the user wishes to bet
        (preferably incriments of 20 up to 100)


STEP 2. Style out your css
       - flexbox should be the best option for the face of the slat machine game
       - the h1 should be above the flex box but still centered
       - the slot windows should be in the top-center of the div/box (they are the face of the project)
       - spin button directly below the windows
       - below spin button, place the users balance to the left of the box
       - on the same line place the 'bet' and bet amount input on the right side of the box
       - at very bottom of box, place a pop up that displays if the user won or lost, but keep its visibility hidden for now
       - play around with fonts, px size, margins, make it look pretty


STEP 3. Time to code your games logic in javascript
       -use the below diagram to structure your js code
         /*----- constants -----*/


            /*----- state variables -----*/


            /*----- cached elements  -----*/


            /*----- event listeners -----*/


            /*----- functions -----*/
        
        - declare constants
        - define state variables but DO NOT DEFINE THEM
        - select and save elements in variables that you will be using more than once
        - add your event listeners, use delegated event listeners
        - use init function
        - create functions
